**P. Vivax (Mlaria) Infected Human Blood Smears** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 1328 images with 86035 labeled objects belonging to 7 different classes including *red blood cell*, *trophozoite*, *difficult*, and other: *ring*, *schizont*, *gametocyte*, and *leukocyte*.

Images in the Malaria Bounding Boxes dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (120 images) and *training* (1208 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the Broad Institute, UK.
