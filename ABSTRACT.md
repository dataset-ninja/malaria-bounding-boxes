The authors of the **Malaria Bounding Boxes** dataset address the ongoing threat of malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium parasites that affects millions globally, causing substantial mortality. They highlight Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax as the main species affecting humans.

In the context of malaria and other microbial infections, manual examination of thick and thin blood smears by skilled microscopists remains the standard approach for detecting parasites and determining their stages. This method is favored due to its cost-effectiveness and adaptability, despite its low throughput and susceptibility to human bias. While automatic counting software exists, its usage is limited due to the complexities presented by variations in brightfield microscopy images. The authors emphasize the potential benefits of a robust automatic counting and cell classification solution, which could yield faster and more accurate quantitative results devoid of human variability. This advancement could enhance drug target characterization and patient reaction quantification.

Prior endeavors to automate malaria identification and quantification have faced challenges in replication, comparison, and extension, often due to the lack of shared image sets and standardized metrics for reporting outcomes. To address these issues, the authors introduce a dataset that encompasses two categories of uninfected cells (*red blood cells* (RBC) and *leukocytes*) and four categories of infected cells (*gametocytes*, *rings*, *trophozoites*, and *schizonts*). Annotators were permitted to label certain cells as *difficult* if their classification wasn't clearly aligned with any specific cell class. The dataset is characterized by a substantial imbalance between uninfected red blood cells, uninfected leukocytes, and infected cells, with the former accounting for over 95% of the total.

Each cell in the dataset is associated with a class label and a set of bounding box coordinates. Infected cells were classified according to their developmental stage by a malaria researcher.

The data was derived from samples of P. vivax infected patients obtained from various labs in Manaus, Brazil, and Thailand. The dataset was divided into training and validation subsets, with samples from Manaus and Thailand being employed for this purpose. Blood smears stained with Giemsa reagent were used to allow malaria researchers to examine infected cells and identify their stages. The dataset's annotations were provided by an expert malaria researcher and encompassed seven labels to represent distinct cell types. The class imbalance was evident, with red blood cells constituting the majority, around 97% of the 100,000 cells in total.

Note, that in the original downloaded data, only *train* and *valid* image sets were provided.
